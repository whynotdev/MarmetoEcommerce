This project is a simple e-commerce layout designed to display products across different categories. It includes basic functionalities like tab switching to view products in different categories and product cards showcasing essential information about each item.


Tab Switching Layout

This project features a tab switching layout where users can toggle between different categories: Men, Women, and Kids. When a tab is clicked, the respective product cards for that category are displayed, while the cards for the other categories are hidden.

Product Card Data

Each product card includes the following data:

Image: Visual representation of the product.
Badge: Additional information about the product, if available.
Product Title: Name of the product.
Vendor: Brand or vendor of the product.
Price: Current price of the product.
Compare at Price: Original price of the product before any discounts.
Discount Calculation

The percentage off for each product is calculated using JavaScript.

Add to Cart Button

Each product card includes an "Add to Cart" button, which is purely visual and does not have any functionality implemented.

Tab Switching Mechanism

Clicking on the "Men," "Women," or "Kids" tab updates the displayed product cards to show the respective category.
The tab switching mechanism is implemented using JavaScript to toggle between tabs and update the displayed product cards accordingly.
